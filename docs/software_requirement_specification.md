  - *Microphone Denied*: Displays dismissible amber alert banner explaining permission steps.
  - *Speech Engine Unsupported*: Mic button displays tooltip suggesting Chrome/Edge; graceful text fallback available.
  - *Cancellation*: Clicking "Cancel" on the status banner aborts listening without query submission.
- **Expected Output**: Transcribed text populated and automatically dispatched to AI backend.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Words appear on screen in `< 100ms` of vocalization; hands-free auto-submission triggers reliably after silence threshold.

#### FR-AI-002: Dual-Provider Failover AI Inference Pipeline
- **Description**: Route queries to Google Gemini 1.5 Flash by default, with automatic circuit-breaker-protected failover to Groq Cloud (Llama 3.3 70B) upon timeout, rate limit, or outage.
- **Priority**: High (P0)
- **User Role Affected**: All Roles
- **Main Flow**:
  1. API Gateway receives prompt at `POST /api/v1/ai/generate`.
  2. Orchestrator inspects Gemini `CircuitBreaker`.
  3. If `CLOSED`, executes query against Gemini 1.5 Flash with 30s timeout.
  4. If successful, records latency, logs token usage, and returns HTTP 200 with result payload.
- **Alternative Flows**:
  - *Gemini 429 Quota or 5xx Outage*: Gemini circuit records failure. Orchestrator immediately shifts traffic to Groq Cloud (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`), records `failoverUsed: true`, and returns completion without client interruption.
  - *Total Provider Outage*: If all provider circuits trip, returns structured `503 Service Unavailable` with `retryAfterSeconds: 30`.
- **Expected Output**: AI completion payload with provider attribution, model name, and execution latency.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Failover switch occurs in `< 50ms`; zero data loss.

#### FR-AI-003: Spoken Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
- **Description**: Convert AI assistant text responses into spoken natural audio using Web Speech API synthesis, complete with sentence chunking, markdown artifact cleanup, and audio controls.
- **Priority**: High (P0)
- **User Role Affected**: All Roles
- **Preconditions**: Browser supports `window.speechSynthesis`.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. AI completion returns from backend.
  2. If query originated from voice input OR if "Voice Output" toggle is checked, `speak()` triggers automatically.
  3. Engine cleans markdown formatting (removing `#`, `**`, ````, URLs) to ensure natural cadence.
  4. Engine splits text into sentence chunks and queues them sequentially into `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`.
  5. UI displays animated sound waves in response bar; button toggles to "Stop".
  6. Speech completes; UI resets gracefully to "Listen".
- **Alternative Flows**:
  - *User Halts Speech*: Clicking "Stop" immediately invokes `speechSynthesis.cancel()`.
- **Expected Output**: High-clarity spoken audio output matching AI response text.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Markdown characters are never verbalized; playback does not stall or truncate on long answers.

### 4.14 Notification Engine & Alert Dispatch (FR-NOTIF)

#### FR-NOTIF-001: In-App and Email Event Notifications
- **Description**: Real-time notification dispatch for leave approvals, payroll disbursements, review submissions, and security alerts.
- **Priority**: Medium (P1)
- **User Role Affected**: All Roles
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Triggering event occurs (e.g. Leave Approved).
  2. Event producer pushes message to Redis notification exchange.
  3. Notification entity persisted in database; client polls/receives update in top bar notification bell.
- **Expected Output**: Unread notification counter and drawer item.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Notifications generated within `< 500ms` of event commit.

                      +--------------------+    +--------------------+
```

### 8.2 Entity Relationship Model
- **`User` (1) <---> (1) `Employee`**: Every employee identity corresponds to a secured user account.
- **`Department` (1) <---> (N) `Employee`**: Employees belong to a primary department.
- **`Department` (1) <---> (N) `Department`**: Self-referencing hierarchical structure for organizational trees.
- **`Employee` (1) <---> (N) `Attendance`**: Daily historical time-card records.
- **`Employee` (1) <---> (N) `Leave`**: Historical leave requests and status logs.
- **`Employee` (1) <---> (N) `LeaveBalance`**: Entitlement ledgers tracking total, used, and pending days per leave type.
- **`PayrollRun` (1) <---> (N) `PayrollItem`**: Monthly batch runs containing granular itemized disbursements.
- **`Employee` (1) <---> (N) `PerformanceReview`**: Quarterly appraisal records with manager evaluations.
- **`AuditLog`**: Append-only log entity capturing actor, action, target entity, and timestamp.
- **`AIRequestLog`**: Token-level inference audit tracking prompt tokens, completion tokens, latency, provider, and failover reasons.

### 8.3 Integrity Constraints & Validation Rules
- All primary keys utilize RFC 4122 compliant Version 4 UUIDs.
- Monetary balances, tax rates, and payroll totals use arbitrary-precision `Decimal(12, 2)` to eliminate IEEE 754 floating-point inaccuracies.
- Date ranges strictly enforced via database check constraints (`endDate >= startDate`).

### 8.4 Retention, Archival & Disaster Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) supported for PostgreSQL with write-ahead log (WAL) archiving.
- Daily automated database snapshots with 30-day retention policies.
- Terminated employee records soft-deleted via status flag (`employmentStatus = TERMINATED`) to preserve historical payroll and tax compliance registers.

---

## 9. Security Requirements

### 9.1 Authentication & Token Rotation Protocol
- Dual-token architecture:
  - **Access Token**: Short-lived (15 minutes), signed with HMAC-SHA256, carrying user ID, email, and system roles.
  - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived (7 days), cryptographically secure random string hashed with SHA-256 before persistence.
- Automatic Refresh Token Rotation: Every refresh request invalidates the presenting token and issues a new pair. If an invalidated token is re-presented, all sessions for that user are immediately revoked.

### 9.2 Authorization & Contextual Access Control
- Mandatory verification of tenant and organizational boundary scoping. Managers cannot view or mutate records outside their assigned department hierarchy.
- Defense-in-depth: Controllers protected by both endpoint-level role guards and service-layer ownership validators.

### 9.3 Cryptographic Standards
- Data at rest encrypted via AES-256 in storage volumes.
- All network transit encrypted with TLS 1.3.
- Sensitive environment configurations (JWT secrets, API keys) injected via Cloud Run runtime secret managers; never checked into version control.

### 9.4 Mitigation of OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Prevented through parameterized queries and Prisma ORM query builder.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: All user inputs sanitized; Next.js automatic React escaping; Content Security Policy (CSP) headers applied via Helmet.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: API design leverages Authorization Bearer headers rather than ambient cookies for state mutation.
- **Brute-Force & Denial of Service**: ThrottlerGuard rate limits API endpoints per IP/User to 100 requests per minute with Redis backing.

---

## 10. Integration Requirements

### 10.1 Dual-Provider AI Inference APIs
- **Primary AI Provider**: Google Gemini API (`@google/generative-ai` SDK) utilizing `gemini-1.5-flash` with a 1,000,000-token context window.
- **Secondary AI Provider**: Groq Cloud API (`groq-sdk`) utilizing `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` with a 128,000-token context window.
- **Failover Logic**: Automated failover triggered on HTTP 429 (Rate Limit), HTTP 5xx (Outage), or network timeout (`> 30,000ms`).

### 10.2 Client-Side Web Speech STT & TTS Integration
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Direct integration with `window.SpeechRecognition` / `webkitSpeechRecognition` with continuous recognition, interim speech event streaming, and silence boundary auto-submission.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Direct integration with `window.speechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`. Automatic markdown cleansing and sentence-boundary splitting to avoid browser audio buffer cutoffs.

### 10.3 Object Storage Integration (S3 / MinIO)
- S3 SDK client connection for binary assets (avatars, PDFs, resumes).
- Pre-signed authenticated URL generation with 15-minute expirations for private documents.

### 10.4 Redis & Message Broker Integration
- Redis 7.0+ for BullMQ job queue management, distributed caching, and shared rate-limiting states.

## 12. Testing and Quality Assurance Requirements

### 12.1 Testing Strategy & Pyramid
The testing strategy enforces quality through automated testing tiers:
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Business logic validation (Payroll calculations, tax brackets, leave accrual, circuit breaker state machine, speech text sanitizers).
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Controller endpoint testing, JWT authentication flows, database operations with test containers.
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Critical user paths (Login -> Clock In -> Request Leave -> Approve -> Run Payroll -> AI Voice Query).

### 12.2 Automated Test Coverage Targets
- Minimum code coverage target of 85% across core backend services and custom React hooks.
- Mandatory zero-warning policy on TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`).

### 12.3 Regression, Security & Browser Compatibility Testing
- Automated Jest test suites run on every pull request.
- Automated security scanning for vulnerable dependencies (`pnpm audit`).
- Multi-browser compatibility testing across Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko rendering engines.

## 16. Constraints

### 16.1 Technical Constraints
- Monorepo package management must strictly use `pnpm` with workspaces; `npm` and `yarn` are prohibited.
- Application must operate within the 2 GiB RAM threshold allocated to Cloud Run container instances.
- Web Speech API requires HTTPS protocol in production environments to activate browser microphone access.

### 16.2 Business & Regulatory Constraints
- Employee data retention must comply with national labor laws, requiring minimum 7-year storage for payroll and tax deduction ledgers.
- PII must be exportable in machine-readable format upon legitimate employee request.
